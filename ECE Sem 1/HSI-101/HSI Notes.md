# Gender Sensitization

>[!important] Key Question
>When does one's identity justify exemption from usual expectations or given special treatment?

## Accommodation

>[!info] Americans With Disabilities Act (1990, revised 2008)
Employers must make *reasonable accommodations* that do not impose an *undue hardship* on the employer for individuals with disability along with specific efforts like*job restructuring and modified work schedule*.
### Is accommodation for disabled "anti-discrimination"?
- **For**: Disability is not an exceptional feature and it providing accommodation to disabled counters discrimination against disabled individuals.
- **Against**: Disability is not an identity like race, gender, ethnicity, etc.
### Accommodation Features:
- Wheelchair ramps
- Widened toilet stalls
- Level shaped door handles
- Braille lettering...
### Beyond Infrastructural Accommodation
**An accessible society is one which has greater opportunities for social and political participation.**
Providing access implies social potential not dependent on correcting the disabled body and is a shift away from attempts to fix or cure the disability on an individual level.

## Gender and Sex
*Sex is a biologically innate term which builds extremely strong expectations of normality*
Gender defines a person socially and culturally, it is influenced by the appearance, behavior and desire of the person rather than just physical qualities.
### Inhuman Laws
1. **Article 377**: It criminalizes homosexuality because it was considered "unnatural" (does not lead to procreation).
2. **Row V Wade**: US Supreme court case on which declared abortion illegal comes from the religious ideas of femininity, incapable of imagining women who decouple sex from procreation.

> *Simone de Beauvoir*'s book *The Second Sex* is a feminist treatise on women's oppression and their role in society
