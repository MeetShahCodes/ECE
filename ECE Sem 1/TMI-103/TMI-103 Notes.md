## Valuation of start up 
### DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)
It is based on the estimated future cash flows. The formula for present value (PV) is
$$PV=\Sigma^{T}_{t=1}\dfrac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$
CF = cash flow in year
r = discount rate 
t = no. of years

### VC (Venture Capital)
The formula for VC method is 
$$V_{post} = \dfrac{TV}{(1 + r)t}$$
Ownership by investor = $\dfrac{C}{V_{post}}$
Where, TV = Terminal value; C = Capital infused by investor;
$V_{post}$ = Valuation post investment

## Incubation 
Business incubators have the same nursery function, where these organizations effectively accumulate, manage and redistribute resources that encourage the survival and development of entrepreneurial projects and young companies. Organisers that help new entrepreneurs just like incubators at IITR. Bergek and Norman said the above statement.
### Types of incubators

- **Economic** - mission to create business and jobs in its region thanks to public resources.
- **Academic** - mission to act as the intermediary between entrepreneurs and university resources.
- **Private** - they just want to find investment opportunities.
- **within companies** - to help projects developed byh the employees.
- **virtual** - use digital resources to support entrepreneurs.
## Accelerators
take 5-10% of companies equity abd guides a batch of several startups for a period of 3 to 6 months.
## Venture studios 
take 30 to 80% of startup equity. Creates multiple startups in the house and then finds entrepreneurs who take then over to grow them.
